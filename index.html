                        <p class="about-text">
                            Brewster created Brewster's Café to give everyone a place to rest their tired wings, or legs - Brewster doesn't descriminate against non-birds! - while filling up on delicious coffee. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            Originally just a small coffee cart, and later a small space called The Roost, and then a cafe near the gallery wing of a nearby island's museum, Brewster spread his wings in early 2022 to create his very own coffee house. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            Using new beans & recipes learned from his time on the island, Brewster also partners with the nearby orchard, fishery, and farm-to-table kitchen to provide food for his patrons. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            Coo, coo, come in and have some coffee, won't you?
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            On Saturdays we have live music from Brewster's friend, DJ K.K.
                        </p>
                        <p class="music-text">
                            DJ K.K. is renown throughout the universe for his expansive music knowledge and constantly changing musical style. Some of his more famous songs include Bubblegum KK, Stale Cupcakes, Café KK, and KK Swing - which is Brewster's particular favorite. Some of his lesser known, but still very enjoyable songs, include Drivin', Animal City, and Farewell. If you're lucky, you may hear one of these while you visit!
                        </p>
                        <p class="music-text">
                            If you'd like to request that DJ KK plays a specific song, please buy a song token for 100 bells directly from Brewster at the coffee bar. You can then present the song token to DJ KK and request your choice of song. Be careful though - even DJ KK's repoertoire has its limits, and if you request a song outside of these, he'll play you a fan favorite instead. Don't worry, you won't be disappointed. After all, all DJ KK songs are good songs. :D  
                        </p>
